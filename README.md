<!----------------------------- Little Disclaimer ------------------------------->
There were some things we could´t figure out with the media queries, we tried to make it as responsive as possible but could not figure out hoe to get the bottom text smaller (Nora send you a teams message on it without a replay on the problem) 
The SVG of the polobear/iceberg is for some odd reason taking up a lot of space and is causing the MQ to have a large margin space on the right side of the screen. (also send a message about this with no luck)
