                analyzed data on polar bears in northeast Alaska and the Northwest Territories

                     And while there’s no question that limiting warming to 1.5° C
                    will be difficult, there’s also no question that we have the

                <p>As the earth continues to warm, crucial habitats may no longer be hospitable

                    This puts a variety of species at risk,

                    The average US citizen emits 20 tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, 
                    most of which come from transportation, electricity generation, and the food system. 
                    (This is 10 times the emissions from the average person in India, for example.) 
                    It’s important for our communities, cities, states, 
                    and country to tackle the climate crisis. 
                    Here are a few ways they can take action:</p>
